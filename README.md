# capsula.github.io
Content and Subject:
Because I work in nonprofit, I wanted to design a page that aligns more with my interest in designing websites for artists, musicians, and filmmakers. 

Capsula is a rock band from Bilbao via Argentina who are good friends of mine. They have stayed with me during SXSW several times and I met them through offering International Housing for the festival. I went to see them in Spain in 2011, and they are launching a US tour this spring. Content was taken from their current website and social media.
 
Design and Function:
I wanted to convey the edgy style of the band, but clean and minimalized, so I chose a simple black background with a bit of color. Their photos are kinetic and powerful, so it was easy to let the visual components speak without over-styling. They have a heavy presence across socal media, so the functionality of the website really jusst needs to compile everything in one spot and easily deliver fans to tour info, tickets, and merch. I also included a mailing list form so fans can receive email updates.

Technology:
This site was built using HTML and CSS in Brackets and resides in a public repository on Github.
